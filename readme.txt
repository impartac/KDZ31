-----------------------------------------
Grades are sorted by the sum of their elements.
null  is Int32.MinValue
IF you choose Sample, then write key, which you want to sample, then write value of this key without any symbols.
Format to sample by grades is : "[val1,val2,val3]" (without quotes)
If null contains in grades,then in memory it replaced by "0". That means, if you want to sample by grades with null, write zero instead of null.
